# Supermarket

A RESTful implementation of web application business logic using Java and Spring to manage inventory, shopping
carts, and checkout of items identified by single characters, with regular and bulk-discount pricing logic.

The goal of this effort was primarily a learning exercise to gain experience with some of the basics of
web applications with some guidance along the lines of design, testing, and to introduce some of the libraries /
 technology stack in use at Jama Software where I am a development intern.

This was my first experience implementing a REST API and using Spring. Notably absent are a teardown process
of a particular cart following checkout, complete error-checking of URL parameters, and the use of HTTP
status codes. These will be added to the issue tracker here and I plan to continue to refine this project
based on this and other feedback I received during desk review.

 Thank you for your attention to this project!
